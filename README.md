# CodilityLessons
The repository contains 100% solutions for all of the core codility lessons with informative comments


When I solved the tasks which I found on codility I faced an issue that sometimes I can't easily find a good solution. In such case I tried to google the solutions by other programmers. I noticed that in some cases there are no good solutions available, while in other cases the solutions are not well documented - code is not well-commented and requires you to spend lots of time to understand what it actually says. I even faced several cases when programmers get 100% result with the usage of extremely complicated techniques, like exhaustive search with pruning, while you could achieve same result with a much simpler code. I decided to write my own solutions and document them as well as possible, and place them here for you to use.
